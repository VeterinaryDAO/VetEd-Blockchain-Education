# Zero-Knowledge Proofs ðŸ“œ

This folder contains educational resources and guides on **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**, a cryptographic method allowing one party to prove knowledge of a value without revealing the value itself.

## Subtopics Covered

- **Implementation Steps:** Detailed steps on implementing ZKP in various use cases.
- **Use Cases:** Examples of real-world applications of ZKP technology.
- **ZKP Theory:** A deeper dive into the theoretical aspects of zero-knowledge proofs.
